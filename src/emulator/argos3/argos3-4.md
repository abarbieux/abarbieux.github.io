## Context

In retirement homes, the physical activity of the occupants is a priority.

Playing to roll the ball in a circle is, for example, a good activity that does not require too much effort from the resident.

However, with limited staff and means, this task is sometimes complicated.

- The kilobot "ball" moving in the circle by "bouncing off" the "walls".
- The kilobot "hunter" moving in the circle him too by bouncing off the walls.
