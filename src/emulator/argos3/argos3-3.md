# Space Attack

[*source code of this tutorial*](../resources/sources/Live.c)

## Context

When you approach two opposite poloarity of a magnet an attraction between them is created.
When you approach the same polarity of a magnet, they pushes each other away.
This is cause by what we can call : "magnetic force".

---

## Goal

The goal of this project was to simulate the magnetic force of the magnets .

---

## Working

This project is a bit special, i was suppose tu work by assigning at each kilobot a polarity : North or Soud.
If kilobot receive a message from a kilobot, he check his polority.
If it is the same, it approaches.
If it is the opposite, he move away.
The concept are simple, but the project was a failure.

## Schema

---

## What you will learn

* Basic template for a kilobot program
* How to make the kilobot flash color with `set_color()`
* How to make the kilobot move with `set_motors()`

## We are done !

You can now admire your kilobot burn the tarmac ! Well, it might not be that impressive. The kilobots were probably not designed as racing machines. But fair enough, it at least made you learn the basics of programming for kilobots !
