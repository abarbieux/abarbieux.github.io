# Space Attack

[*source code of this tutorial*](../resources/sources/Live.c)

---

## Context

This project is based on a variant of the game "Space Invader".
The goald of the original game was too explode all the alien with your ship on his laser gun.
But in this version, the goal was too shoot the meteore before they blow up the base.

---

## Goal

The goal of this project was to simulate a video Game with the kilobots.

---

## Working

we place the kilobots to make a grid (for example a square of 6x6 kilobots).

We launch the game which makes the ship appear on the far left on the first row of kilobots (symbolized by a blue color swap  of the kilobot).

Then the ship  move to right or to left while destroying the asteroids that will appear by firing his lasez at each movment.

The game ends if the ship is destroyed or if an asteroid reaches the last row of kilobots.

## Schema

---

## What you will learn

* Basic template for a kilobot program
* How to make the kilobot flash color with `set_color()`
* How to make the kilobot move with `set_motors()`

## We are done !

You can now admire your kilobot burn the tarmac ! Well, it might not be that impressive. The kilobots were probably not designed as racing machines. But fair enough, it at least made you learn the basics of programming for kilobots !
